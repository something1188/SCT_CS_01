A lightweight and beginner-friendly web-based tool to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a static webpage that allows users to apply Caesar Cipher logic directly in the browser using JavaScript, styled with CSS, and structured with HTML. Itâ€™s ideal for learning basic frontend logic and classical cryptography techniques.

ðŸ”§ Features
Encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher

Choose any shift value (positive or negative)

Retains non-letter characters like spaces, punctuation, etc.

Simple and responsive UI for easy usage

ðŸš€ Getting Started
You can run this project directly in your browser.

Option 1: Use Online
visit the live version here:
<pre>https://something1188.github.io/SCT_CS_01/</pre>

Option 2: Run Locally
Clone the repository:

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/something1188/SCT_CS_01.git</pre>

Open the project folder and launch index.html in your browser:
<pre>
cd SCT_CS_01
start index.html</pre>
That's it!

ðŸ§  How It Works
JavaScript captures user input: the message and shift value.

It loops through each character, checks if itâ€™s a letter, and shifts it by the given value.

Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.

The result is displayed in a read-only text box below.

ðŸ§ª Example
Input: Hello, World!
Shift: 3
Encrypted: Khoor, Zruog!
Decrypted (with -3): Hello, World!
